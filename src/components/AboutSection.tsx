      </h2>

      <p className="mb-6 text-lg leading-relaxed">
        Hi! I'm <strong>Savannah Harvey</strong>, a Software Engineering major
        at <strong>Brigham Young University-Idaho</strong>. I have a strong passion for
        cloud computing and enjoy learning how software can scale and connect
        people around the world.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-6 text-lg leading-relaxed">
        I love building web applications, solving problems, and exploring new
        technologies that make software faster, more reliable, and easier to use.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-6 text-lg leading-relaxed">
        Outside of my studies, I enjoy working on projects with real-world impact
        and collaborating with other developers to create meaningful solutions.
      </p>

      <p className="text-center italic text-indigo-600 text-lg">
        Let's connect! If you're interested in software development or cloud
        technologies, I'd love to chat.
